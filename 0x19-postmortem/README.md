Oops! The Authentication Service Had a Coffee Break ‚òïÔ∏è
The Incident
Duration: From midnight to early morning on April 8, 2024 (UTC).
Impact: The user authentication service decided to take a nap, resulting in login failures for some users. About 30% of users were left scratching their heads.

The Culprit
The sneaky culprit behind this snooze fest was none other than a misconfigured firewall rule. It decided to block incoming connections like a bouncer at a party, leaving our application servers stranded outside.


Timeline of Events
12:00 AM (UTC): Our monitoring system frantically waved its virtual arms, alerting us to unusually high error rates.
12:05 AM (UTC): Engineers grabbed their magnifying glasses and dove into the logs, discovering the database's silent treatment.
12:15 AM (UTC): We played detective, suspecting network issues or a grumpy database server.
12:45 AM (UTC): No luck with our sleuthing, so we called in the database administration superheroes.
1:00 AM (UTC): The heroes found the misconfigured firewall rule hiding in the shadows.
1:15 AM (UTC): With a swift fix, we gave the firewall rule a pep talk and allowed connections again.
1:45 AM (UTC): Our authentication service woke up from its coffee-induced nap, ready to greet users again.
Root Cause and Solution
Root Cause: The firewall rule thought it would be fun to play hide and seek with our application servers.
Solution: We had a serious chat with the rule and showed it the right path, allowing connections once more.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:

Implement automated monitoring to catch firewall rule shenanigans early.
Foster better communication between teams to tackle issues like a well-oiled machine.
Tasks Ahead:

Organize a "Firewall Rule Awareness Day" with fun activities like pin the port on the server.
Conduct regular rule audits to keep them in line with security policies.
Update our incident response playbook with a chapter on calming down misconfigured rules.
Now, with a touch of humor and a colorful diagram, our postmortem is not just informative but also entertaining! üöÄ
